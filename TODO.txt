0. unit/functional tests
1. views integration  
2. allow for injection of parameters in a transition
  - hook_wf_field_transition_{FIELDNAME}__{TRANSITIONID}__form()
    provide a form that exposes additional info/parameters to be mixed into the transition & the resulting state    
  - hook_wf_field_transition__{FIELDNAME}___{TRANSITIONID}__form_alter($object, &$form, $form_state)?
3. store more metadata for each state an "instance" of node/entity can be in (responsible user, due by date etc.)
4. more hooks: wf_field_states_alter($object, $instance, $params=array() )  - alter available states for an object/entity
5. cover all kinds of entities
6. nicer workflow modelling and tag/group "states" (end,start)
